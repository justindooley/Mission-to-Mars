# Mission-to-Mars
### Web Scraping, MongoDB, and Flask Application
I have completed Step 1 of the assignment by web scraping in a Jupyter Notebook. One of the necessary websites to complete this assignment was down, https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars. I remedied this by using the WayBack Machine from Archive.org.  
I will commit Step 2 of the assignment when I have a working code.
